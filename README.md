# Christian's Personal Hub

This is a web app built with FastAPI and Python. It's purpose is to track all the stuff I think is important and have it available in one place with an easy to use UI. I thought about just making it command line, but the ease of using web-native for literally everything is too powerful for me. I wanted to make a local QT app or something, but that requires way too much brain power and architectural forethought for such a low-ROI project.
